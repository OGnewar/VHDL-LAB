## Using structural model,write a code in VHDL to implement full adder.(2077 ,2075 regular , 2073 back)

# Full Adder

This repository contains VHDL code for a full adder (`Full_Adder`) and its corresponding testbench (`tb_full_adder`). 

## Simulation Duration

Each test case is simulated for a duration to allow sufficient observation of the full adder behavior.
